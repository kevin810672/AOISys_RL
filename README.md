### Requirements

* CCD Contrl (Visual Studio 2012)
	- uEye.h: I utilized IDS uEye camera so that I downloaded the .h file from the iDS website https://www.pixoel.com.tw/download.html
	          and then set the relative parameters of uEye in Visual Studio 2012.
	- OpenCV: to Covert array which obtained by the camera to image. Also need to set the relative parameters of OpenCV in Visual Studio.

* Image Processing and Moniter (Python)
	- OpenCV
	- Numpy
	- matplotlib

* File management and Light Control (Python)
	- serial (RS232)

* Reinforcement Learning (Python)
	- Tensorflow
	- sklearn
	

### Execution

1. run CCDCtrl.exe
2. run main.py in Py file
3. run Moniter.py in Py file to observe the learning process
